# Escala MVP implementation brief

## Product outcome

Deliver a working seller support-operations dashboard inspired by Shopee Seller Centre patterns. A seller can inspect a prioritized inbox, understand why a conversation needs attention, review verified knowledge evidence, request a safe recommendation, and record an approval/edit/escalation decision. This is a seller-side decision-support tool, not an autonomous marketplace agent.

## Equal worker split

| Worker | Owned scope | Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `build_1` (Astra) | Responsive seller inbox UI, visual system, navigation, conversation queue/detail, evidence/order context, seller decision controls, accessible loading/error/empty states | `src/app/**`, `src/components/**`, `src/styles/**`, frontend-only assets/config as coordinated |
| Claude Code + DeepSeek V4 Pro | Next.js API routes, MongoDB repositories/index/seed, OpenAI Responses adapter, deterministic policy/urgency, grounding, recommendation and decision audit persistence, API validation/fallback | `src/app/api/**`, `src/server/**`, `src/domain/**` implementation helpers, persistence/config docs as coordinated |

`src/domain/contracts.ts` is the shared API contract and is owned by the orchestrator. Workers should import it and not change it without coordination. Keep UI and API implementation in their owned paths. No worker commits; integration and sole commit belong to the orchestrator.

## User journeys

1. Open the seeded inbox and see counts plus sorted urgency/reason labels.
2. Select a thread and review buyer messages, product/order snapshot, and relevant verified evidence.
3. Generate or refresh a recommendation. If the model/provider fails or evidence is missing, the interface clearly offers non-automatic seller review.
4. Approve/edit a safe draft, ask one clarification, or escalate. This only records a local seller decision; never sends a buyer message or mutates a marketplace order.
5. Reopen the page and see persisted state and audit history.

## Acceptance criteria

- MongoDB Atlas backs MVP data and can be pinged through the app's health endpoint; seed data is synthetic and idempotent.
- OpenAI is called server-side only with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, model `gpt-5.6-luna`, reasoning effort `xhigh`; API secrets never enter browser bundles or logs.
- LLM output is treated as untrusted. Structured output is schema-validated and deterministic policy can downgrade/block any proposed automatic action.
- Each recommendation and seller decision has a timestamped audit record, policy version, reason/evidence IDs, and actor/action.
- The app works at desktop and mobile widths, provides clear loading/empty/error states, and uses keyboard-visible controls and reduced-motion support.
- No real Shopee integration, external sending, order mutation, or copied DOCRELAY code/assets.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build` pass once configured. User requested the app be tested and started.
## Environment

See `.env.example`. Runtime model configuration is `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-luna` and `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT=xhigh`. `OPENAI_API_KEY` belongs only to the Escala runtime. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` belongs only to Claude Code. `VERCEL_TOKEN` is to be created by the user in the Vercel account and pasted into ignored `.env.local`.
